# Automation Testing

Automating railway ticket search on makemytrip.com with Selenium WebDriver streamlines testing, enhances efficiency, and ensures accuracy. Scripts navigate the website, interact with elements, input journey details, and perform actions such as clicking search buttons. This process delivers seamless user experiences and reliable ticket search functionality.
